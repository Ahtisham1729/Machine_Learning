# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of small machine learning projects created as part of my learning process. Each project focuses on a different task, method, or dataset to build practical understanding of key ML techniques.

## Structure

Each folder is a self-contained project with its own data, results, and notebook(s):

- `cantilever_mlp_regression/` – MLP regression on FEM displacement data from a 2D cantilever beam.
- `surface_defect_clustering/` – Unsupervised clustering of steel surface defect images using PCA and K-Means.

More projects will be added as I continue exploring the field.

## Note

These projects are experimental and educational in nature.
